# Exploratory Data Analysis of Amazon Prime Video Content Library

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Amazon Prime
Video content library to understand content distribution, trends, and patterns using
data visualization and statistical analysis techniques.

## Problem Statement
Amazon Prime Video hosts a large and diverse collection of movies and TV shows.
Due to the vast amount of unstructured data, it is difficult to identify content trends,
popular genres, release patterns, and rating distribution without systematic analysis.
This project aims to apply EDA techniques to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## Datasets Used
- **titles.csv**: Contains metadata about movies and TV shows including title, type,
  genres, release year, age certification, duration, and IMDb ratings.
- **credits.csv**: Contains information about cast and crew such as actors, directors,
  and their roles in each title.

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of Movies vs TV Shows
- Identify popular genres on Amazon Prime Video
- Study content release trends over the years
- Explore rating patterns and content characteristics

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab
- GitHub
